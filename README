This repository exists to ease the setup of new shell accounts. It contains:

* Shell configurations (bashrc, bash_aliases, inputrc etc)
* Vim configurations (vimrc, etc)
* Fonts
* Any neato scripts I find
* An install script.

The install script attempts to backup any existing dotfiles in a new folder called ~/dotfiles_old, and
creates symlinks in their place that point to the associated files in your local Git cloned repo. If on
a MacOS machine, it tries to install fonts to ~/Library/Fonts, otherwise the fonts will be located in
~/.fonts which will work in most Linux environments.

## Installation
    ./install.sh
    
## Warranty
None.

This is a configuration that I like and it works for me. You are free to use it, but at your own risk.
